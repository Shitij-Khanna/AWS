Login to AWS:
Select RDS from services
Select Create DB
Oracle is Not available on Free Tier so for testing and demo we can use mysql, for oracle we need license and paid tier, where we pay for the server.

Complete the configurations :
Give name of DB : mySqlDB1
Create a new security group : lets say : RDS-SG , to be able to access this DB
Do other general configurations like username, pwd, name of DB etc
Size of disk to be selected as per requirement , like 20gb, etc and option can be selected to increase the size dynamically

Complete the configurations and select 'Create database'

After 10 minutes, the instance is up with the dns and port:
E.g dns : mysqldb1.cwtcwndkemno.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com
port : 3306

However, it is not yet accessible publicly. 
For that, go to Security Groups : 
This can be done by selecting the security group from the bottom of the page of the newly created RDS instance.
Select the Inbound section of the security group, and add the configuration / IP / Security group of your app server / web server, from where you want to access this RDS instance.
We can also enable this RDS instance to be publicly accessible, but that is not desirable and secure.
Ideal practice is to add the ip addresses of all servers in the inbound section, so that only they are able to connect to this DB.
Or we can also add them to a common security group, and add this security group to the inbound section, so that all servers in that security group are able to connect to this DB.

PS : For testing purposes we need to create a MYSQL DB, because Oracle is not available on a free tier. But, the process of creating a DB instance on AWS is the same, we will just need separate license and configurations for the instance we need to create.
